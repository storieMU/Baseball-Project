**1. Introduction:**

    1.1. Base Goals:

    The design of this database is focused around keeping baseball players, team information, statistics, stadium, and all           related relations so that a user may access this information through a GUI.  

	1.2 Stretch Goals:

    Allow for the user to log in and have a custom roster saved, allow for delete/save of players, and teams allow for custom        backgrounds.

**2. System Requirements**

  To have access to our project an Internet connection and a modern web-browser such as Firefox, Chrome, or IE is required. An     updated version of Java may also be required. 

    2.2 Architecture
     
    The application will be created using web-based technologies such as PHP, JavaScript, JSON, and may incorporate a JavaScript     or PHP framework. The web-based program will then access a database hosted on babbage where all information is held. 

    2.3 Hardware
    
    To access the application only a network connection and modern browser are required. No other hardware should be necessary. 

**3. User Requirements**

    3.1 Expectations

    It is expected that the user will be able to pick any player, team, or manager and pull their statistics from the previous       seasons. The user is expected to be able to use the keyboard and mouse to select positions on a GUI, which will pull             statistics and allow for searching, sorting, and upon reaching our stretch goal saving favorite players.

    3.2 Performance

    A GUI will be present that will be in the shape of a baseball diamond and it will allow for clicking on individual position      to pull up player information for that position.

    3.3 Functions

     The application will allow for a user to view game state for any player from any team. They will be able to select the            position based off the GUI. They will be able to read information about their favorite players. 

    3.4 Constraints and Controls

    The application will allow for user input from either the
    mouse or the keyboard. The data will be stored within a database on babbage.

**4. Functional Requirements**

  4.1 Services

    The services that will be provided by this game are a GUI for
    enhanced usability. .

  4.2 Software

    The software is expected to have the ability to allow for
    a person to pick players and view individual statistics. They will 
    also be able to select players from positions on a GUI.

  4.3 State Logic

    The players will first pick either a position or can search for the team.
    Once they have picked either the player or the team they will be able to sort through
    the entire list and select individual statistics.

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

  5.1  Software Contraints

    The game will be hosted on the babbage server with all logic stored
    on babbage. 

  5.2 Development Constraint

   It will take approximately 35 days to complete the program and have
   it fully functional and ready for consumers to play.
